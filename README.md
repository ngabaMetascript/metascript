# MetaScript  

**MetaScript** is a programming language inspired by **C++**, specially designed for creating virtual environments and simulations. It aims to provide a powerful and intuitive syntax, suitable for developers wishing to build dynamic and immersive digital worlds.

---

## 🚀 Fonctionnalités  

- **Syntax inspired by C++**: Familiar structure for developers.
- **Graphics Engine Integration**: The MetaScript Architecture is designed to be compatible with existing graphics engines (from the most powerful like UNreal Engine to the lightest like Phaser)
- **Dynamic connectors**: Integration of modular components to connect logical elements.
- **Advanced simulation**: Abstraction tools and realistic event management.
- **Extensible**: Allows you to add new modules and extensions according to the needs of the project.
- **MetaScript Compiler** *(in development)*: Ensures efficient translation of MetaScript code into executable binary.

## 🔧 Installation and Compilation

**Prerequisites:**
- `gcc` or any other C++ compiler
- Python3.10 *(if your compiler includes Python management scripts)*
- ( Download Graphical Engine CryEngine, Unreal Engine, three.js ... )

### Installation Steps

( The Metascript Compiler is still in development )
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-user/MetaScript.git
cd MetaScript
```

2. Compile the project:
```bash
make
```

3. Run an example:
```bash
./metascript examples/hello_world.ms
```

## 📄 Code Example

Here is a simple example in MetaScript:

( First version, C++ Based )
```metascript
class Simulation {
void start() {
print("Welcome to MetaScript!");
}
}

Simulation s;
s.start();
```
